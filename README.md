# mongo-scraper

Mongo scraper goes to a website and scrapes all the stories off of it and then displays them. Once they are displayed you can add notes to them or comments and delete or save the stories.

The scrape is done with cheerio and is saved to the mongo database. There is also HTML, CSS and JS within this app.
